# Implementation

## General:
The default representation of a leaf (for demos, etc.) should be a character:
'-' denotes an empty node
Parents should be denoted with capital letters: A,B,C,...
Children should be denoted with lowercase letters: a,b,c,...
This representation is a matter of convention, though it allows an easy way to print out a text representation of the tree.

## Python:

print_tree: Prints a text representation of a binary tree to the console or a text file.
Takes as arguments a string representing the tree (in the form of a binary heap of characters).

Implementation notes:
Can cut down on some of the add_new_level_flag checking?

subtree: Returns a subtree.
Takes as arguments the tree and the position of the node from which to start taking the subtree.

Implementation notes:
Can be made much more efficient for large trees by searching for most-significant bit instead of 2**floor(log(x)).
Perhaps more work can be done on determining an analytic formula for the subtree size?
The lower and upper bounds seem to be tight.
