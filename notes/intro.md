# Project: Trilobite (The abstRact manIpuLation Of BInary TreEs)

## Goals:

A software library that contains high-level routines for the manipulation of binary trees. 

## Objectives:

It is intended that the library will be abstract, customisable and elegant.

### Abstract:
The routines will manipulate binary trees. Binary trees crop up all over computer science and in coding projects, with a variety of different implementations. To make adoption easier, it is hoped that the project will 'slot in' with already existing code. In Java this could be achieved by providing an interface that leaf objects in a tree must implement to give basic information to the tree manipulation routines.

### Customisable:
There are very many tasks that one might want to achieve through some combination of binary tree search, insertion, deletion and replacement. It is hoped that the library will provide scripting abilities which will allow users to write concise subroutines to solve hard problems. Additionally, it is not hard to write a routine to traverse a binary tree in some order and perform some simple operation (e.g. delete all triangle leaves). The customisability of the library should make it attractive to potential users.

### Elegant:
The idea for this project came about as a result of work I did on [Grafter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leafpine.calc), a smart calculator for students out on release on Google Play. Grafter employs extensive manipulation of binary trees in its computer algebra system. Much of the code became bloated and hard to understand. After playing with the idea of rehauling the routines, I thought it would be attractive to create an elegant interface to manipulate binary trees, the details of which aren't exposed to coders who just want to achieve some goals.

### Summary:
If I had to summarise I would say the goal for Trilobite is to be to binary trees what Regex is to strings.
